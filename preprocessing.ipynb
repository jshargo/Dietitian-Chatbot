Poultry and other  meats should always be cooked before eating.12  Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Vegetarian and vegan diets have been followed for thousands of  years for different reasons, including as part of a spiritual practice,  to show respect for living things, for health reasons, or because of  environmental concerns. For many people, being a vegetarian is a  logical outgrowth of “thinking green.” A meat-based food system  requires more energy, land, and water resources than a plant-based  food system. This may suggest that the plant-based diet is more  sustainable than the average meat-based diet in the U.S.By avoiding  animal flesh, vegetarians hope to look after their own health and  that of the planet at the same time. Broadly speaking, vegetarians  eat beans, grains, and fruits and vegetables, and do not eat red  meat, poultry, seafood, or any other animal flesh. Some vegetarians,  known as lacto vegetarians, will eat dairy products. Others, known  as lacto-ovo vegetarians, will eat dairy products and eggs. A vegan  diet is the most restrictive vegetarian diet—vegans do not eat dairy,  eggs, or other animal products, and some do not eat honey.  Vegetarian diets have a number of benefits. Well-balanced eating  plans can lower the risk of a number of chronic conditions,  including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. They also help to  promote sustainable agriculture. However, if a vegetarian does not  vary his or her food choices, the diet may be insufficient in calcium,  12. Raw Food Diet. WebMD.com.https://www.webmd.com/ diet/a-z/raw-foods-diet.

Here we will take a closer look at particular groups of people  who may require extra calcium intake.  • Adolescent teens. A calcium-deficient diet is common in  teenage girls as their dairy consumption often considerably  drops during adolescence.  • Amenorrheic women and the “female athlete triad“.  Amenorrhea refers to the absence of a menstrual cycle.  Women who fail to menstruate suffer from reduced estrogen  levels, which can disrupt and have a negative impact on the  calcium balance in their bodies. The “female athlete triad” is a  combination of three conditions characterized by amenorrhea,  disrupted eating patterns, and osteoporosis. Exercise-induced  amenorrhea and anorexia nervosa-related amenorrhea can  decrease bone mass.23 In female athletes, as well as active  women in the military, low BMD, menstrual irregularities, and  individual dietary habits together with a history of previous  2.

       "  'text': 'Undernutrition,  Overnutrition, and  Malnutrition  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  For many, the word “malnutrition” produces an image of a child in  a third-world country with a bloated belly, and skinny arms and  legs. However, this image alone is not an accurate representation of  the state of malnutrition. For example, someone who is 150 pounds  overweight can also be malnourished.  Malnutrition refers to one not receiving proper nutrition and does  not distinguish between the consequences of too many nutrients  or the lack of nutrients, both of which impair overall health.  Undernutrition is characterized by a lack of nutrients and  insufficient energy supply, whereas overnutrition is characterized  by excessive nutrient and energy intake. Overnutrition can result  in obesity, a growing global health threat. Obesity is defined as a  metabolic disorder that leads to an overaccumulation of fat tissue.  Although not as prevalent in America as it is in developing  countries, undernutrition is not uncommon and affects many  subpopulations, including the elderly, those with certain diseases,  and those in poverty. Many people who live with diseases either  have no appetite or may not be able to digest food properly. Some  medical causes of malnutrition include cancer, inflammatory bowel  syndrome, AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, illnesses or conditions that  cause chronic pain, psychiatric illnesses, such as anorexia nervosa,  or as a result of side effects from medications. Overnutrition is an  epidemic in the United States and is known to be a risk factor for  many diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,  inflammatory disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and cancer.
